<!--
I’d love to read about your ideas! Keep in mind, though, that I’m a single person working on this project. The script focuses on URL and search bar selection behavior only, and ideally this repo shouldn’t even exist.

Please explain what I should include in the shell script and why. Requests concerning compatibility, usability, and code quality are always welcome.
